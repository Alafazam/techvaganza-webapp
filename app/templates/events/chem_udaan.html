        <h2>CHEM-UDAAN(CHEMICAL ROCKET)</h2>
        <section>
            <p>As the world is becoming more and more advanced in technology, an even greater amount of energy is being used to keep up with the changing requirements. At the current rate at which energy is being used, the world will shortly come to an end of fossil fuels - the world's primary energy resource. You think you can fly, think again! In our event, here you have to fly a rocket with the help of chemical reaction.</p>
