            <h3><b>Event description:</b></h3>
            <p>Industrial Training is an extremely important aspect for every engineering student and every engineering college as well. Many students don’t have ample opportunities around them to complete their industrial training with satisfaction and without making capital investment which is demanded by most of the private companies for industrial training. Sometimes students end up mugging only the theoretical concepts and lack an insight into the practicalities of their core subjects. Thus, this event cum workshop aims to provide students an industrial training of the electrical systems present at NIT Srinagar and the surrounding areas. Faculty members from the department of electrical engineering will be guiding the students about the electrical arrangements present in the college itself. Not only will this help students in developing a clearer picture about the field of their work but it will help in devising better electrical schemes for the improvement of our college as well. A visit to Chashme Shahi Grid Station will also be there. At the end of the event students will be required to submit a report (not more than 10 pages) about the ways to increase the efficiency of various electrical systems and arrangements present in the college. This event will be highly beneficial for the students of electrical engineering. Students of all branches can participate. It’s completely free of cost for the participants.</p>
