        <section>
            <p>Every year Techvaganza has been taking up initiatives to play its part as a non-profit organization in generating awareness and developing an inclination of youth populace towards the problems existing in their surroundings. Smart City Challenge is such an initiative to engage the youth of the country in the development of cities and prosperity of its citizens. The Challenge has been designed with the vision of bringing together technology, government and the student fraternity to make the cities more efficient, sustainable and livable and to improve the quality of life of rapidly urbanizing population 
<p>The idea is to enhance human, economic and social development, reduce costs and optimize resource consumption.</p>
<p>Imagine if your city could talk - if it could give live status updates on traffic patterns, pollution, parking spaces, water, power and light. Imagine how that kind of information could improve the economic and environmental health of the city. Imagine how it could improve working conditions and productivity for the people who maintain the city. Techvaganza NIT SRINAGAR aims to provide a credible platform to the students to disseminate their
ideas and come up with sustainable, equitable and human-friendly design delivering innovative and holistic services for building smart cities with an integrated and digitally enriched urban environment.</p>
<p>So, are you ready for the most exciting event of Techvaganza 2K15.
