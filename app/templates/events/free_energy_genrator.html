        <h2>FREE ENERGY GENERATOR</h2>
        <section>
            <p>These days, more and more are become interested in free-energy. Free energy means energy sources for which we donâ€™t have to pay or you have to pay very low amounts. This event is all about ideas and innovations that how are implemented in order to mere sustainable free energy device by which we get maximum output with minimum input and this thing is known as zero cost energy or free energy. It is process of generation of electrical energy that is almost free of cost, with the help of electrical and electronic circuitry. The basic concept of generation of free electricity is with the help of magnetic imbalancing and magnetic locking properties. The Magnetic motor has no coils hence no power losses and hence can be used as free energy generator. we can genrate small level power through free energy model.</p>
