            <p><b>(Build your own wired or wireless robot and be ready for race with mechanically based obstacle.)</b>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Introduction :</b></h3>
            <pre> <p>"It takes two flints to make a fire "     -Lousia May Alcott</p></pre>
            <p>Human existence is broadly classified into three categories â€“ Dependence, Independence and Interdependence. Man is a social animal and so dependence as well as independence is insufficient to harness the utmost capabilities among us.
                <br>Time to buckle up for something innovative .The strength of the team is each individual member, the strength of each member is the team. Be ready to coordinate with members in the arena where your comprehensive skills will be put to test.</p>

            <h3><b>Event format:</b></h3>
            <p>Build a manual wired (no need of programming based robot) or a wireless bot capable of traversing the uneven and erratic realms in the way and reach the final line in minimum time.</p>
        </section>

            <h3><b>Event details:</b></h3>
            <h3>Problem statement:</h3>
            <p>Going through a highway with all your speed proves nothing. But your speed through our arena is all that you can prove. So get ready with your own creation of wired or a wireless robot which can prove its ability. Prove your speed by completing the least time possible.</p>
            <h3>Bot specification:</h3>
            <p>Bot should fit in a box of 25cm*25cm*25cm at start of the event and should weigh less than 2 kgs.</p>
