            <p>With the help of this event we can aware human being about pollution that effects our whole environment, health of human being and so many things very badly. So event will force the people to think over a pollution free car(i.e.-electric car). This event is not related only with a particular branch of engineering. It mainly about the innovative ideas of participants that how he/she can implement his/her idea into a new concept that will helpful for future. In this event participants have to make a car prototype only by raw material given to them. By the help of this event participants will learn the maximum use of raw material, motor, many types of battery and how a battery works.</p>
